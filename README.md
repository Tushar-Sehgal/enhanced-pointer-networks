# Enhanced Pointer Network with Attention Mechanism

This repository contains the enhanced version of the Pointer Network implementation, based on the original work by Guillem96. The enhancements include:
- Deeper LSTM layers for improved sequence encoding.
- Updated attention mechanism for better performance on complex sequences.
- Optimized training and batch processing.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Tushar-Sehgal/enhanced-pointer-networks

cd enhanced-pointer-nn-pytorch

### Create and activate a virtual environment using venv or conda.

#### For example, using venv:

python -m venv pointer_env

source pointer_env/bin/activate

#### On Windows use:

pointer_env\\Scripts\\activate

### Install dependencies

#### Install all the required dependencies using pip from the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the model

#### You can run the model by executing the ptr_net.py file:

python ptr_net.py

## Acknowledgments

This code is based on the original Pointer Network implementation by Guillem96. I have made enhancements to the architecture and training process. Full credit goes to the original author for the base implementation.
